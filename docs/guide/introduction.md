# What is Portyl?

Portyl is a lightweight, framework-agnostic TypeScript library to load files, manage pagination/state, and render to a canvas. It cleanly separates processing from rendering so you can process once and render anywhere.

## Why itâ€™s useful (at a glance)
- Separation of concerns: process files once, render multiple times
- Canvas-first rendering: fast, predictable visuals
- Desktop friendly: works well with Electron/Tauri patterns
- TypeScript-first: strong types across the API

For a deeper look at the architecture, see the [API Overview](/api/overview).
